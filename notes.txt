Command Prompt:
used to run git commands
cd= change directory
md= make directory
Directory=dev
Computer Funndamentals:
Computer=Hardware (physical) +Software 
Github:
If you have a computer, it saves in the github cloud so if your
current computer breaks, you can still use github on another
computer with all the information
Bring javaclass to computer. You make code and push it to cloud
and then bring it back to the computer with another command
Command to add to computer (make a copy): 
git clone <url>

Commands to add stuff to the cloud
git add *
git commit -m "new comments added"
git push

To check the status:
git status
